# Fetal-Health-Classification
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify fetal health conditions with high accuracy while minimizing labeled data requirements. Using Active Learning and the XGBoost classifier, the model achieves 99%+ accuracy while utilizing less than 20% of the dataset for training, making it a cost-effective solution for medical diagnostics.
